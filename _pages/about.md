My research interest includes multiphase flow, non-Newtonian fluid and rheology of complex fluid.

Currently, I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dingyi Pan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=07CrM9QAAAAJ) from, Zhejiang University. I was also advised by [Prof. Zhen Jian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CBafobUAAAAJ) from Xi'an Jiaotong University during my undergraduate period.
